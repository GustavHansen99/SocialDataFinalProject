    <h2> Initial idea - Carbon Emissions of buildings in San Francisco </h2>
        <h3> Data </h3>
        <p> 
            The initial idea of the final project in Social Data Analysis and Visualization was to investigate the carbon emissions of buildings in San Francisco based on the data from the San Francisco Energy Benchmarking Ordinance. The data set contains information about the energy use and carbon emissions of buildings in San Francisco, and is available on the <a href="https://data.sfgov.org/Energy-and-Environment/Existing-Buildings-Energy-Performance-Ordinance-Re/j2j3-acqj"> San Francisco Open Data Portal. </a> This dataset presents basic information about energy use and implications (estimated greenhouse gas emissions, gas use, electricity use, and district steam use); and compliance status for private-sector (non-municipal) properties and contain data last updated in February 2023.
        </p>
        <h3> What and how? </h3>
        <p> 
            Based on the data set, the initial idea was to investigate the carbon emissions of buildings in San Francisco, and to investigate whether there is a correlation between the carbon emissions and the age of the buildings. The idea was to visualize the data in a map of San Francisco, where the buildings would be colored according to their carbon emissions. The map would also contain a slider, where the user could choose a specific year, and the map would then show the carbon emissions of the buildings in that year.
            More concretely, we created the project A assignment from this idea, and hence it can be seen described more thoroughly in the video below. (Please excuse the rapid speech, we were trying to fit it into the 1 minute ;) )

        <p> 
            However, we have decided not to follow through on this idea. We identified that the project would eventually lead to the inevitable conclusion that older buildings emit more carbon than newer buildings, and that this would not be a very interesting conclusion. Therefore, we spent time trying to enhance the dataset with additional building information or demographics about the different neighoborhoods in San Francisco. This was possible, but then we identified that the building dataset was very narrowly focused on buildings in the busy neighborhoods of San Francisco, and that the dataset did not contain information about the buildings in the more rural areas of San Francisco. These thoughts and issues ultimately led us to believe that another project would be more challenging and interesting to investigate.

  <h2> Project Idea 2.0 - 3-1-1 Cases in San Francisco </h2>
    <h3> Data </h3>
        <p> 
            Instead of the building emissions dataset, we have chosen to focus our attention towards the extremely interesting dataset of 3-1-1 cases in San Francisco. 3-1-1 is an easy-to-remember telephone number that connects customers with highly-trained Customer Service Representatives ready to help you with non-emergency City and County of San Francisco government matters. Based on residents, businesses and tourists' calls to 3-1-1, the City and County of San Francisco has created a dataset of all the 3-1-1 cases in San Francisco. The dataset contains information about the type of case, the date of the case, the neighborhood of the case, the status of the case, and much more. The dataset is available on the <a href="https://data.sfgov.org/City-Infrastructure/311-Cases/vw6y-z8j6"> San Francisco Open Data Portal. </a> The dataset gets updated daily, and contains data from 2008 to the present. At present time (1st of May 2023) the data contain 6.11 million rows and 21 columns, where each row corresponds to a 3-1-1 case.
